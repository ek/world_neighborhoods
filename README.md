# World Locations Database

World locations hierarchical database. Extracted from [ChefSurfing.com](https://chefsurfing.com/).

* Initialized with United Nations data.
* In `data` folder there's a YML file per each country with it's divisions and
  cities. We'd like to add neighborhoods in biggest cities (now we only have
  Buenos Aires neighborhoods).
* Location names are typically in english.
* There's no other attribute than the location name and position in the
  hierarchy yet.
* Has some errors, goal is to correct it/polish it through Pull Requests to
  this repository.
