# World Neighborhoods

World Neighborhoods is a world-wide locations database.

The goal is to build a hierarchycally organized list of world-wide locations,
from Countries to Neighborhoods.

It was  extracted from [ChefSurfing.com](https://chefsurfing.com/).

## How to contribute

In `data` folder there's a file per country with it's divisions, cities and
neighborhoods list hierarchycally organized.

You may edit the files either through Github's web interface (just go to the
file you want to improve, click "Edit this file" link and send the updates),
or through forking and sending Pull Requests.

The only requirement is the correctness of additions and updates (of course),
and to follow [YAML's format](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML#Language_elements).
